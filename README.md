## üìñ How to Use

### Method 1: Page Action Icon

2. Look for the extension icon in the address bar
3. Click the icon to open Gemini in the sidebar
4. Gemini will automatically receive the video URL for summarization

### Method 2: Right-Click Context Menu

1. Visit any YouTube page (homepage, search results, channel pages, etc.)
2. Right-click on any video thumbnail
3. Select "Summarize with Gemini" from the context menu
4. The sidebar will open with Gemini ready to summarize the selected video

### Method 3: Direct Sidebar Access

1. Click the extension icon in the Firefox toolbar
2. If you're on a YouTube video page, it will automatically prepare for summarization
3. Otherwise, navigate to a YouTube video first

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Configuration

The extension includes a settings page where you can customize its behavior:

### Access Settings

1. Right-click the extension icon in the Firefox toolbar
2. Select "Options" from the context menu
3. Or go to `about:addons` ‚Üí find the extension ‚Üí click "Options"

### Available Settings

#### Custom Prompt Template
- Customize the prompt sent to Gemini for video summarization
- Use `{videoUrl}` as a placeholder for the YouTube video URL
- Default: Optimized prompt for comprehensive video analysis

#### Auto-Mark as Watched
- **Enabled (Default)**: Videos are automatically marked as "Already Watched" in YouTube when summarized via right-click
- **Disabled**: Videos are only summarized without affecting your YouTube watch history
- This feature helps prevent summarized videos from appearing in your recommendations

### How Auto-Mark Works

When you right-click a video thumbnail and select "Summarize with Gemini":

1. The extension opens Gemini in the sidebar for summarization
2. **If auto-mark is enabled**: The extension automatically navigates YouTube's interface to mark the video as "Already Watched" by:
   - Finding the video's three-dot menu
   - Clicking "Not interested"
   - Selecting "Tell us why"
   - Choosing "I've already watched the video"

This process happens in the background and helps keep your YouTube feed clean of videos you've already consumed through summaries.
